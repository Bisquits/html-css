With the new HTML5 features, modify the form so that:

- The formula input field suggests the following options when the user starts to type: "sin", "cos", "tan" and "cot".
- The iterations input field is a slider with possible values from 1 to 10.
- The precision input field is a number picker with possible values from 1 to 100, where 50 is the default value.
