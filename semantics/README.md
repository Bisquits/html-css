Update the website's HTML, without using JavaScript or CSS, to make use of semantic elements so that:

    - The classless outer div element is replaced with a more appropriate element.
    - The divs with the image and caption classes are replaced with self-contained content elements.
    - The divs with the lorem-ipsum and description classes are replaced with elements, so that by default only the contents of the description element are shown. When the contents of the description element are clicked, the visibility of the rest of the lorem-ipsum element is toggled.
